## Hi there, I'm Ali👋

I'm a game developer working primarily with **Godot**, focused on building complete, functional systems and shipping finished projects.

I enjoy working on:
  - Gameplay systems and mechanics
  - Structured, modular code
  - Game jam projects and fast iteration under constraints

---
### What I'm working on
  - Improving and polishing my recent game jam project
  - Expanding my portfolio and public repositories
  - Continuously learning better ways to design and organize game systems

---
### How I work
  I value:
  - Consistency over bursts of motivation
  - Finishing what I start
  - Learning through building, testing, and refining
  - I prefer clean logic, readable code, and systems that can grow over time.

### Featured work
  - 🎮 **Game Jam Project** – A complete, submitted game built under time constraints
